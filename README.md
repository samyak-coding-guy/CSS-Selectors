Selectors :-
Review

Throughout this lesson, you learned how to select HTML elements with CSS and apply styles to them. Letâ€™s review what you learned:

CSS can select HTML elements by type, class, ID, and attribute.
All elements can be selected using the universal selector.
An element can have different states using the pseudo-class selector.
Multiple CSS classes can be applied to one HTML element.
Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.
Specificity - IDs are more specific than classes, and classes are more specific than type. That means IDs will override any styles from a class, and classes will override any styles from a type selector.
Chaining - Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the specificity but can be necessary.
Descendent Combinators - Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.
Multiple Selectors - Multiple unrelated selectors can receive the same styles by separating the selector names with commas.
